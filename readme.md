### a plain js web scraper for a task I need done regularly

this scraper hits a local camera store every 24 hours and looks
for a variety of items that I want to purchase. It saves that information
in a JSON file on my desktop.

It should send me an email or an alert of some kind if a new item that
I want pops up on the camera store's site. Some kind of mailer should be potentially added.
